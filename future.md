## Performance Research

### 1. Custom Memory Allocators
**Status:** Research
**Potential Impact:** Medium-High
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Explore memory pooling optimized for Go's garbage collector.

**Ideas:**
- `sync.Pool` optimization for listener slices
- Pre-allocated listener buffers with strategic reuse
- Reduce allocations during listener add/remove
- Better cache locality through memory layout

**Potential Benefits:**
- Reduced GC pressure (fewer allocations)
- Better cache utilization
- Predictable memory usage

**Challenges:**
- Must work with Go's GC (not against it)
- Complexity vs benefit trade-off
- Benchmarking required to validate

**Realistic Assessment:** Worth exploring for hot paths, but avoid fighting Go's GC.

---

### 2. Better Worker Pool Strategies
**Status:** Research
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Explore alternative worker pool patterns for async signals.

**Ideas:**
- Work-stealing queues (per-worker queues with stealing)
- Affinity scheduling (listeners pinned to workers)
- Adaptive worker strategies (different patterns for different loads)
- Goroutine pool vs channel pool trade-offs

**Potential Benefits:**
- Better CPU utilization
- Reduced goroutine creation overhead
- Improved cache locality

**Realistic Assessment:** Incremental improvements possible, not revolutionary changes.

---

### 3. Lock-Free Queue Improvements
**Status:** Research
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Evaluate production-ready lock-free queue implementations.

**Ideas:**
- MPSC (multi-producer, single-consumer) queues for worker pools
- Bounded lock-free queues for backpressure
- Compare against channel performance

**Libraries to Evaluate:**
- https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures
- Custom implementations using atomic.Value

**Realistic Assessment:** Channels are well-optimized in Go; gains may be marginal.

## API Enhancements

### 1. Listener Groups
**Status:** Idea
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Organize listeners into groups for bulk operations.

**Features:**
```go
// Add listeners to a group
sig.AddListenerToGroup("analytics", listener1, "listener1")
sig.AddListenerToGroup("analytics", listener2, "listener2")

// Remove entire group
sig.RemoveGroup("analytics")

// Enable/disable group
sig.SetGroupEnabled("analytics", false)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Feature flags (enable/disable listener groups)
- Plugin systems (add/remove plugin listeners together)
- Testing (easily mock out listener groups)

**Realistic Assessment:** Useful and straightforward to implement.

---

### 2. Listener Chaining
**Status:** Idea
**Potential Impact:** Low-Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Simple listener composition patterns.

**Features:**
```go
// Chain listeners in sequence
sig.AddChain(
    validateListener,
    processListener,
    notifyListener,
)

// Conditional listeners
sig.AddConditional(
    func(ctx context.Context, e Event) bool { return e.Priority > 5 },
    highPriorityListener,
)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Processing pipelines
- Conditional execution
- Cleaner code organization

**Realistic Assessment:** Nice syntactic sugar, but users can already do this.

---

### 3. Signal Middleware
**Status:** Idea
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Middleware pattern for cross-cutting concerns.

**Features:**
```go
// Add middleware (wraps all listeners)
sig.Use(loggingMiddleware)
sig.Use(metricsMiddleware)
sig.Use(tracingMiddleware)

// Middleware signature
type Middleware[T any] func(
    next SignalListener[T],
) SignalListener[T]
```

**Use Cases:**
- Logging all signal emissions
- Timing all listener executions
- Error handling/recovery
- Distributed tracing

**Realistic Assessment:** Very practical, aligns with Go middleware patterns.

```go
// Record mode
recorder := signals.NewRecorder[Event]()
sig.Use(recorder.Middleware())

// ... run application ...

// Replay in tests
for _, event := range recorder.Events() {
    testSignal.Emit(context.Background(), event)
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Testing with real production events
- Debugging production issues
- Performance testing with real data

**Realistic Assessment:** Valuable for testing, relatively simple to implement.

### 2. Signal Assertions for Testing
**Status:** Idea
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Testing utilities for signal-based code.

**Features:**
```go
// Test helper
assert := signals.NewAssertion[Event](t, sig)

// Emit and assert
sig.Emit(ctx, event)
assert.EmittedOnce()
assert.EmittedWith(func(e Event) bool {
    return e.Type == "expected"
})
assert.ListenerCalled("listener-key", 1)
```

**Realistic Assessment:** Very practical, improves testing experience.

---

### 3. Performance Profiling Helpers
**Status:** Idea
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Built-in integration with Go's profiling tools.

**Features:**
- Automatic pprof labels for signal emissions
- Per-listener CPU/memory profiles
- Integration with `go test -bench -cpuprofile`

## Integration Helpers

### 1. HTTP Handler Integration
**Status:** Idea
**Potential Impact:** Medium
**Go-Specific:** Yes

Helpers for common web framework patterns.

**Features:**
```go
// HTTP middleware that emits request signals
handler := signals.HTTPMiddleware(requestSignal, http.HandlerFunc(...))

// WebSocket signal bridge
signals.WebSocketHandler(sig, upgrader)

// Server-Sent Events
signals.SSEHandler(sig, w)
```

**Frameworks:**
- Standard library `net/http`
- Popular routers (Chi, Gorilla Mux)
- Optional adapters for Gin, Echo, Fiber
