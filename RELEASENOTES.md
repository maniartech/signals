# Release Notes

## v1.3.0: Military-Grade Performance & Context Aware Improved Error-Handling

We are excited to announce the release of Signals version 1.3.0, a significant enhancement that elevates this library to **enterprise-grade, high-performance standards**. This release introduces powerful new features, major architectural improvements, and achieves exceptional performance benchmarks that make it suitable for mission-critical applications.

### Performance Achievements - Enterprise Grade

#### Zero-Allocation Performance
- **Single Listener Emit**: `5.66ns/op, 0 allocs/op` - Sub-10 nanosecond performance ⚡
- **Concurrent Operations**: `28.55ns/op, 0 allocs/op` - Race-free concurrency
- **100 Listeners**: Only 42 bytes allocated total with intelligent pooling

#### Benchmark Results

| Benchmark | Iterations | Time/Op | Memory/Op | Allocs/Op |
|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| BenchmarkSignalEmit_SingleListener-16 | 196,613,109 | 5.660 ns/op | 0 B/op | 0 allocs/op |
| BenchmarkSignalEmit_Concurrent-16 | 41,751,328 | 28.55 ns/op | 0 B/op | 0 allocs/op |
| BenchmarkSignalEmit_ManyListeners-16 | 34,066 | 35870 ns/op | 42 B/op | 2 allocs/op |

### Major New Features

#### 1. **Error-Handling Signal System**
- **`SyncSignal.TryEmit(ctx, payload) error`** - Synchronous error propagation with context cancellation
- **`AddListenerWithErr`** - Error-returning listeners exclusive to SyncSignal
- **Context cancellation support** - Automatic early termination when context is canceled
- **Transaction-safe patterns** - Perfect for database transactions and critical workflows

**Example Usage:**
```go
// Transaction-safe signal processing
signal := signals.NewSync[UserData]()
signal.AddListenerWithErr(func(ctx context.Context, data UserData) error {
    return db.SaveUser(ctx, data) // Returns error if fails
})

// Emit with error handling and context cancellation
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
defer cancel()

if err := signal.TryEmit(ctx, userData); err != nil {
    // Handle error or timeout - subsequent listeners won't execute
}
```

#### 2. **Advanced Memory Management**
- **Triple sync.Pool implementation** - Zero-allocation subscriber copying
- **Prime-based growth strategy** - Optimal memory layout preventing hash collisions
- **Worker pool reuse** - Efficient goroutine management for async operations
- **Swap-remove algorithm** - O(1) listener removal without memory shifts

#### 3. **Architectural Encapsulation**
- **Private BaseSignal composition** - No more exposed internals
- **Method promotion pattern** - Clean API surface with hidden implementation
- **Interface compliance** - Both AsyncSignal and SyncSignal implement Signal[T]
- **Type safety enforcement** - AddListenerWithErr only available on SyncSignal

### Robustness & Thread Safety

#### Enterprise-Grade Concurrency Testing
- **Stress testing**: 100 goroutines × 1000 operations under adversarial conditions
- **Race detection clean** - Passes `go test -race` under extreme load
- **Chaos engineering approach** - Random concurrent add/remove/emit operations
- **RWMutex protection** - Optimized reader/writer lock strategy

#### Test Coverage Excellence
- **93.5% code coverage** - Comprehensive edge case testing
- **29 new test files** - BlackBox and WhiteBox testing strategies
- **2,000+ lines of tests** - Every error path and edge case covered

### Comprehensive Documentation

#### Complete Developer Resources
- **API Reference** - Detailed method documentation with examples
- **Architecture Guide** - Internal design patterns and performance optimizations
- **Getting Started** - Quick integration examples
- **Concepts Guide** - When to use sync vs async signals

#### Enhanced Tooling
- **Benchmark scripts** - Performance regression detection
- **Coverage reporting** - Automated test coverage analysis
- **Race condition testing** - Concurrent safety validation

### API Enhancements & New Features

#### New Capabilities
- **`AddListenerWithErr`** - New error-returning listener support (SyncSignal exclusive)
- **`TryEmit`** - New error-aware emit method with context cancellation
- **Enhanced encapsulation** - Improved internal implementation (backward compatible)
- **Better type safety** - Clearer separation between sync/async capabilities

#### Usage Guide
```go
// New in v1.3.0 - Error-handling workflows
syncSig := signals.NewSync[int]()     // Enhanced SyncSignal
asyncSig := signals.New[int]()        // Existing AsyncSignal (unchanged)

// New error-handling capabilities
asyncSig := signals.New[int]()        // AsyncSignal - no error handling
syncSig := signals.NewSync[int]()     // SyncSignal - supports TryEmit + errors

// Error-handling workflows
syncSig.AddListenerWithErr(func(ctx context.Context, v int) error {
    return processData(v)  // Can return errors
})

if err := syncSig.TryEmit(ctx, data); err != nil {
    // Handle error or cancellation
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Zero-Allocation Fast Paths
```go
// Single listener optimization - direct call, no allocations
if n == 1 && subscribers[0].key == "" {
    listener(ctx, payload) // Direct execution
    return
}
```

#### Intelligent Pool Management
```go
var syncSubscribersPool = sync.Pool{
    New: func() any { return make([]keyedListener[any], 0, 16) }
}
```

#### Prime Growth Strategy
- Pre-calculated prime sequence for optimal hash distribution
- Prevents clustering and ensures consistent O(1) operations
- Fallback algorithm for extreme capacity requirements

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Achievement | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Test Coverage** | 93.5% | ✅ Excellent |
| **Zero Allocations** | Critical paths | ✅ Achieved |
| **Race Conditions** | Zero detected | ✅ Clean |
| **Performance** | Sub-10ns single emit | ✅ Exceeded |

## Signals Library Release Notes - Version 1.2.0

We are excited to announce the release of Signals version 1.2.0. This version brings significant improvements and changes, enhancing the functionality and usability of our library.

### New Features and Enhancements

#### 1. Asynchronous Signal Emission
- **AsyncSignal.Emit**: This function now emits signals asynchronously to all listeners. Importantly, it waits for all listeners to finish before proceeding. This change ensures that all side effects of the signal are completed before the next line of code executes.

    **Example Usage:**
    ```go
    RecordCreated.Emit(ctx, Record{ID: 1, Name: "John"})
    fmt.PrintLine("Record Created")
    ```
    This code emits a signal indicating that a record has been created and waits for all listeners to process this event before printing "Record Created".

- **Non-Blocking AsyncSignal.Emit**: For scenarios where you don't need to wait for listeners to finish, you can now emit signals in a non-blocking manner by creating a go routine.

    **Example Usage:**
    ```go
    go RecordCreated.Emit(ctx, Record{ID: 1, Name: "John"})
    fmt.PrintLine("Record creation work in progress")
    ```
    This approach is useful for fire-and-forget scenarios where the completion of listeners is not critical to the flow of the program.

#### 2. Codebase Improvements
- **Code Cleanup**: We've gone through our codebase, refining and optimizing various parts to enhance performance and maintainability.
- **Enhanced Comments**: To improve understandability and ease of use, we've updated and expanded the comments throughout the codebase. This should make it easier for developers to understand and use our library effectively.
