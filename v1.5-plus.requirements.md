# Version 1.5+ Requirements (Future Roadmap)

## Overview

This document outlines features and enhancements planned for v1.5 and beyond. These items are deferred from v1.4 to allow focus on core performance, API ergonomics, and observability improvements.

## Version 1.5 (Planned)

### Primary Focus: Advanced Pool Management and Metrics

#### 1. Dynamic Worker Pool Scaling
**Status:** Deferred from v1.4
**Priority:** MEDIUM

Implement intelligent worker pool scaling based on actual load patterns.

**Requirements:**
- Automatic pool size adjustment based on queue depth and throughput
- Configurable scaling policies (aggressive, conservative, custom)
- Smooth scaling transitions without performance degradation
- Metrics for pool scaling events and efficiency
- Graceful worker shutdown during scale-down

**Success Criteria:**
- Pool automatically scales to handle traffic spikes
- No performance degradation during scaling events
- Resource usage optimized for actual load (not over-provisioned)
- Well-documented scaling behavior and tuning guidelines

---

#### 2. Advanced Metrics Aggregation
**Status:** Deferred from v1.4
**Priority:** MEDIUM

Enhance metrics capabilities with aggregation, sampling, and advanced analytics.

**Requirements:**
- Time-series metrics aggregation (windowed statistics)
- Configurable sampling rates for high-cardinality metrics
- Histogram support for latency distributions (not just p95/p99)
- Metric correlation (e.g., error rate vs latency)
- Efficient storage and query of historical metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- Low memory overhead even with extended metric retention
- Support for 1000+ metrics/sec collection rate
- Query API for historical metric analysis
- Integration with time-series databases (optional)

---

#### 3. Performance Profiling Integration
**Status:** Deferred from v1.4
**Priority:** LOW

Built-in support for continuous performance profiling.

**Requirements:**
- CPU profiling hooks for listener execution
- Memory allocation tracking per listener
- Goroutine leak detection
- Integration with pprof endpoints
- Performance regression detection

**Success Criteria:**
- <0.5% overhead when profiling enabled
- Easy identification of performance bottlenecks
- Automated performance regression alerts
- CI/CD integration for continuous profiling

---

## Version 1.6+ (Long-term Vision)

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Formal Verification
**Status:** Research phase
**Priority:** LOW

Apply formal methods to verify critical properties.

**Rationale:** Requires specialized tools and expertise. Valuable for highest-assurance systems.

**Potential Approach:**
- Model checking for concurrency properties
- Proof of lock-freedom and progress guarantees
- Verification of memory safety properties
- TLA+ or similar formal specification

---

#### 2. Listener Prioritization
**Status:** Idea
**Priority:** LOW

Support for listener priority levels and ordered execution.

**Use Cases:**
- Critical listeners execute before non-critical ones
- Ordered processing pipelines
- Resource allocation fairness

---

#### 3. Backpressure and Flow Control
**Status:** Idea
**Priority:** MEDIUM

Advanced flow control mechanisms for async signals.

**Features:**
- Bounded queues with configurable backpressure strategies
- Flow control signals to emitters
- Rate limiting per signal or globally
- Circuit breakers for failing listeners

---

#### 4. Signal Composition and Transformation
**Status:** Idea
**Priority:** LOW

Functional programming patterns for signals.

**Features:**
- Signal filtering (only emit if condition met)
- Signal mapping (transform payload before emission)
- Signal merging (combine multiple signals)
- Signal splitting (one signal â†’ multiple derived signals)

---

#### 5. Distributed Signals (Optional Extension)
**Status:** Research
**Priority:** LOW

**Note:** Only as optional extension package, NOT in core library.

For applications that need to coordinate signals across processes/machines:
- gRPC-based signal propagation
- Pub/sub integration (NATS, Redis, Kafka)
- Distributed tracing integration
- Consensus for ordered delivery

**Critical:** This would be a separate package/module, keeping core library focused on in-process signals.

## Deferred Items from v1.4

The following items were considered for v1.4 but deferred to future versions:

### From Functional Requirements
- **Dynamic Pool Scaling:** Moved to v1.5 (complexity requires more research)
- **Advanced Metrics:** Basic metrics in v1.4, advanced aggregation in v1.5
- **24-hour Fuzz Testing:** Reduced to 1 hour for v1.4, extended runs in v1.5+

### From Non-Functional Requirements
- **Chaos Testing:** Deferred to v1.5+ (focus on stress testing in v1.4)
- **Circuit Breakers:** Deferred to v1.6+ (application-level concern)
- **Formal Verification:** Deferred to v1.6+ (requires specialized expertise)
- **SBOM Generation:** Deferred (nice-to-have, not critical for v1.4)
- **Signed Releases:** Standard practice, but formal signing deferred

### From Success Metrics
- **Geographic Distribution Tracking:** Deferred (not measurable for open-source)
- **Industry-Specific Adoption Metrics:** Simplified to general production usage
- **Fortune 500 Claims:** Removed (let adoption speak for itself)
- **Market Position Goals:** Removed (focus on quality, not marketing)

## Research Areas

### Performance Optimization
- Lock-free queue implementations for worker pools
- NUMA-aware scheduling for high-core-count systems
- Custom memory allocators for listener storage
- Zero-copy signal emission techniques

### Usability Improvements
- Signal debugging tools and visualizers
- Performance analysis dashboards
- Interactive tuning guides
- Best practice linters/analyzers

### Ecosystem Integration
- Framework integrations (web frameworks, message queues)
- Language bindings (if demand exists)
- IDE plugins for signal debugging
- Observability platform certifications

## Principles for Future Development

### 1. Core Simplicity
The core library must remain simple, focused, and dependency-free. Advanced features should be:
- Optional (via interfaces/plugins)
- Separate packages/modules when possible
- Well-documented with clear use cases

### 2. Performance First
Any new feature must:
- Have <1% performance impact when disabled
- Include comprehensive benchmarks
- Not degrade fast paths
- Be opt-in if any overhead exists

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes within major version
- 6-month deprecation notice minimum
- Migration guides for all changes
- Automated migration tools when possible

### 4. Production Focus
Features must solve real production problems:
- Validated by user feedback
- Tested at production scale
- Documented with real-world examples
- Integrated with production tools
