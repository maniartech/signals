# Version 1.5+ Requirements (Future Roadmap)

## Overview

This document outlines features and enhancements planned for v1.5 and beyond. These items are deferred from v1.4 to allow focus on core performance, API ergonomics, and observability improvements.

---

## Version 1.5 Objectives

Version 1.5 builds on v1.4's foundation to provide **intelligent resource management and production-grade observability** for high-scale deployments.

### Primary Goals

1. **Adaptive Resource Management**: Enable worker pools to automatically adjust to varying load patterns, optimizing resource usage without manual tuning.

2. **Deep Observability**: Provide advanced metrics, aggregation, and profiling capabilities to enable data-driven performance optimization and troubleshooting.

3. **Production Hardening**: Extend testing and validation to ensure reliability at extreme scales and in edge cases.

4. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce operational burden through intelligent defaults and self-tuning capabilities.

### Target Outcomes

- **Auto-scaling**: Worker pools adjust automatically to handle 10x traffic spikes without degradation
- **Metrics Retention**: Support for time-series metrics with configurable retention (hours to days)
- **Performance Visibility**: Built-in profiling identifies bottlenecks without external tools
- **Operational Simplicity**: 90% of deployments require zero pool size tuning
- **Production Validation**: Proven at 1M+ signals/sec sustained load

- TLA+ or similar formal specification

---

#### 2. Listener Prioritization
