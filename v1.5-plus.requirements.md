# Version 1.5 Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines features and enhancements planned for v1.5. These items are deferred from v1.4 to allow focus on core performance, API ergonomics, and observability improvements in that release.

**Future Roadmap:**
- **v1.6 Requirements**: See [v1.6-requirements.md](v1.6-requirements.md) for advanced patterns and formal verification
- **Future Ideas**: See [future.md](future.md) for speculative research areas and community ideas

## Version 1.5 Objectives

Version 1.5 builds on v1.4's foundation to provide **intelligent resource management and production-grade observability** for high-scale deployments.

### Primary Goals

1. **Adaptive Resource Management**: Enable worker pools to automatically adjust to varying load patterns, optimizing resource usage without manual tuning.

2. **Deep Observability**: Provide advanced metrics, aggregation, and profiling capabilities to enable data-driven performance optimization and troubleshooting.

3. **Production Hardening**: Extend testing and validation to ensure reliability at extreme scales and in edge cases.

4. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce operational burden through intelligent defaults and self-tuning capabilities.

### Target Outcomes

- **Auto-scaling**: Worker pools adjust automatically to handle 10x traffic spikes without degradation
- **Metrics Retention**: Support for time-series metrics with configurable retention (hours to days)
- **Performance Visibility**: Built-in profiling identifies bottlenecks without external tools
- **Operational Simplicity**: 90% of deployments require zero pool size tuning
- **Production Validation**: Proven at 1M+ signals/sec sustained load

## Functional Requirements (v1.5)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

Enhance metrics capabilities with aggregation, sampling, and advanced analytics.

**Requirements:**
- Time-series metrics aggregation (windowed statistics)
- Configurable sampling rates for high-cardinality metrics
- Histogram support for latency distributions (not just p95/p99)

### Compatibility

#### API Compatibility
- **100% backward compatibility** with v1.4.x
- **Opt-in features**: All new features disabled by default

- Same as v1.4 (Go 1.18+, Linux/macOS/Windows, amd64/arm64)
- Additional testing on high-core-count systems (64+ cores)
- Validation on ARM-based servers (AWS Graviton, etc.)

### Documentation

#### Production Guides
- **Auto-scaling tuning guide**: How to configure scaling policies
- **Metrics best practices**: What to collect and when
- **Profiling cookbook**: Common profiling scenarios and solutions
- **Migration guide**: Step-by-step upgrade from v1.4

#### Examples
- Reference implementations for each scaling policy
- Metrics dashboard templates (Grafana, custom)
- Profiling integration examples
- Load testing scenarios and tools

## Deferred Items from v1.4

The following items were considered for v1.4 but deferred to v1.5:

### From Functional Requirements
- **Dynamic Pool Scaling:** Moved to v1.5 (complexity requires more research)
- **Advanced Metrics:** Basic metrics in v1.4, advanced aggregation in v1.5
- **Extended Fuzz Testing:** 1 hour in v1.4, 24+ hours in v1.5

### From Non-Functional Requirements
- **Extended Testing:** Basic property tests in v1.4, comprehensive in v1.5
- **Advanced Profiling:** Simple metrics in v1.4, integrated profiling in v1.5

### Rationale

v1.4 focuses on the foundation (lock-free architecture, basic observability, API ergonomics). v1.5 builds sophisticated capabilities on that solid foundation.

---

## Timeline
- v1.4 should be stable and adopted in production before v1.5 work begins
- Minimum 6 months of v1.4 production feedback before v1.5 feature freeze
- Community input on scaling policies and metrics requirements

**Note**: Timeline subject to change based on v1.4 adoption and feedback.

## Migration Path from v1.4.x

All v1.4.x code will continue to work without changes. New features are opt-in:

```go
// Existing v1.4 code - no changes needed
sig := signals.NewSignal[Event]()

// New v1.5 features - opt-in

// Dynamic pool scaling
opts := signals.SignalOptions{
    WorkerPoolSize: 0, // 0 = auto-scale
    ScalingPolicy: signals.ScalingPolicyAggressive,
    MinWorkers: 10,
    MaxWorkers: 1000,
}
sig := signals.NewWithOptions[Event](opts)

// Advanced metrics with time-series
metricsOpts := signals.MetricsOptions{
    Enabled: true,
    Retention: 1 * time.Hour,
    SamplingRate: 0.1, // 10% sampling for high-cardinality
}
sig.EnableMetrics(metricsOpts)

// Query time-series metrics
snapshot := sig.MetricsSnapshot(
    time.Now().Add(-5 * time.Minute),
    time.Now(),
)

// Profiling
sig.EnableProfiling(true)
profile := sig.GetProfile() // Per-listener statistics
```

## Dependencies on v1.4

v1.5 builds upon v1.4 features:

- **Lock-free architecture** (v1.4) enables efficient pool scaling
- **Basic metrics** (v1.4) provide foundation for advanced aggregation
- **API ergonomics** (v1.4) ensure clean integration of new features

**Recommendation**: Production deployments should use v1.4 for at least 3-6 months before upgrading to v1.5 to ensure v1.4 stability.

---

## Next Steps

After v1.5 stabilizes:
- **v1.6**: Advanced patterns and formal verification (see [v1.6-requirements.md](v1.6-requirements.md))
- **Future**: Research areas and speculative ideas (see [future.md](future.md))
